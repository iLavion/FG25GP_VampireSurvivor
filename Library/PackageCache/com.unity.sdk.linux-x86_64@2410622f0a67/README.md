Please note that the components of the sysroot are subject to a variety of licenses detailed in the LICENSE.md file. While Unity itself does not use any of the provided libraries in a way that triggers any copyleft effects, you need to make sure that if you use native code in your project, said code adheres to the requirements of the licenses mentioned above. Specifically, the GCC runtime is subject to a GPL license, but it is also subject to the GCC runtime linking exception which applies to how the Unity player is using it.
